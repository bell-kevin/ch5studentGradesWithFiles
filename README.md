# ch5studentGradesWithFiles
Write a program that asks the user to input multiple test scores for a number of students, calculates the average score for each student, and writes the student name and average to a file. Use a sentinel-controlled loop to ask the user if they have more student information to enter. For each student, ask for the student's name (a single name, not first and last names), then ask for 3 test scores which can contain decimal values between 0 and 100. Calculate the average of those 3 test scores. On the console, display the student's name and average, with 1 decimal place, and always show the decimal value. Also write that data to a file. When all input has been completed and the results written to the file, write a line on the console that says "Done writing to file".
